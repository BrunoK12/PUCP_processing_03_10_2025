# PUCP_processing_03_10_2025
Thanks to the High Energy Group of TAMBO at the Physics Department of PUCP, especially to Francisco Garc√≠a, for providing the initial processing code. This version expands and improves upon it by adding new functionalities such as pickle dataset generation, data filtering, and the n-rotation mechanism to enhance secondary particle detection.

This code processes the .txt output files generated by CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray Showers) to produce serialized pickle datasets. It extracts both the raw (pure) data and the filtered (detected) data corresponding to particles captured by the detector array. Additionally, the code implements an n-rotation mechanism, where each simulated shower is rotated n times to increase the likelihood of detecting secondary particles.
