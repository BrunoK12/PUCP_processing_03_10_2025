This code processes the .txt output files generated by CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray Showers) to produce serialized pickle datasets. It extracts both the raw (pure) data and the filtered (detected) data corresponding to particles captured by the detector array. Additionally, the code implements an n-rotation mechanism, where each simulated shower is rotated n times to increase the likelihood of detecting secondary particles.
